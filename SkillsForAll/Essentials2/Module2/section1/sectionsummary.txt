1. Computers store characters as numbers. There is more than one possible way of encoding characters, but 
only some of them gained worldwide popularity and are commonly used in IT: these are ASCII (used mainly to 
encode the Latin alphabet and some of its derivates) and UNICODE (able to encode virtually all alphabets 
being used by humans).

2. A number corresponding to a particular character is called a codepoint.(eg: 32 for whitespace)

3. UNICODE uses different ways of encoding when it comes to storing the characters using files or computer 
memory: two of them are UCS-4 and UTF-8 (the latter is the most common as it wastes less memory space).

BOM (Byte Order Mark) is a special combination of bits announcing the encoding used by a file's content 
(eg. UCS-4 or UTF-8).
